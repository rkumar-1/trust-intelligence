Our social lives revolve around friends and family we trust, isn't it? Is it fair to say, "Trust" is like an oxygen to our social media lives. Twitter CEO holds this view. This project came into being when the Twitter Team published an RFP to measure how trustworthy their "social media platform" is to users at any given point in time? Are there goblins that need to be extinguished and the good guys that need to be encouraged? 

This project started as a technology proposal with a few measely ideas on developing a few convenient trust measures, which we will call as trust-intel TIN model for short.

FIGURING OUT WHAT TO MEASURE

What does this system that we are going to measure look like here? 

A bunch of tweets showing up one after the other in a never ending stream, isn't it? 

FIND ME SOME RABBITS

We are aware of the never ending streaming nature of twitter platform. It is fascinating to think what prompts these humans to keep on typing their thoughts. 

OK. Well. At any rate, we don't want to deal with an infinite number of tweets to begin with our systme analysis journey. Our minds and machine learning toolkits like to review simple data, first. So, our first strategy is to patiently wait for a small amount of time and take a snap shot of all the tweets that show up in that period of time on the twitter platform. The length of the time is entirely our decision and simply depends on what we plan to do with these tweets.

That should give us a data file. I am christening this file as "rabbit.txt" as each tweet looks like a rabbit to me.


At least it is clear to us, a "Tweet" is a simple enough unit of data on this platform.
